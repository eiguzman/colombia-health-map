    <h1>Visualizing Dengue in Colombia</h1>

    <p>
      Dengue fever, a viral illness transmitted by Aedes (Aedes aegypti) mosquitoes,
      is a growing public health concern in tropical regions worldwide.
      In Colombia, the disease has seen significant variations in incidence from 2007 to 2019,
      with the eastern regions of the country consistently reporting the highest rates. These areas,
      characterized by warm temperatures and tropical landscapes, provide ideal conditions for the Aedes mosquitoes,
      which thrive in humid environments with stagnant water.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project explores the geographical factors that influence the spread of dengue in Colombia.
      By mapping dengue trends over time, we can better understand how regional variations and climate conditions
      contribute to the disease's distribution. The heatmap visual presents a clear picture of dengue incidence across
      the country,
      while the top 10 municipal bar graph highlights the areas most affected by the virus.
      Through this analysis, we aim to find patterns and conclusions on the complex relationship between environmental
      and infrastructural factors
      that shape the spread of this mosquito-borne disease in Colombia.

    <h2>Key Takeways</h2>
    <p>
      Through the analysis of dengue fever cases in Colombia from 2007 to 2018, several important trends emerge. First,
      municipalities like Florencia, Fortul, and Nilo consistently appear as hotspots in different years, highlighting
      that certain areas are more vulnerable due to localized environmental or social factors. Epidemic years, such as
      2010, show dramatic spikes in incidence rates, suggesting that dengue outbreaks can escalate rapidly
      under specific conditions. Conversely, endemic years like 2011, 2017, and 2018 show much lower case numbers,
      indicating periods of relative control. The shifting locations of outbreaks suggest that while some areas improve
      (e.g., Florencia after 2011), others can become new centers for the virus (e.g., Nilo in later years).
      Importantly, western Pacific coastal municipalities remain consistently low in incidence, likely due to their
      colder and wetter climates, which inhibit mosquito breeding. Overall, this analysis emphasizes the dynamic nature
      of dengue outbreaks, the need for targeted public health interventions in high-risk municipalities, and the
      importance of understanding local environmental and socio-economic factors that drive these patterns.
