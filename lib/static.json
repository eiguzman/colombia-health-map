    {"year": -1, "description": "The region with the highest levels of dengue incidence rates was concentrated in eastern Colombia. This area is characterized by large open savannas in the north and tropical jungles in the south. Both regions have greater inland temperatures than the mountain and coastal municpalties. This climate can make this region a hotspot for mosquitos carrying the dengue virus. Suprisingly throughout all the years, the center municipalities of Colombia have historically low incidence rates. Upon further review of these geographic area, many features reduce the proliferation of dengue in these regions. First, Bogota, the capital of Colombia, is located in this region. Its status as the capital also alludes to its high gdp per capita, improving social and basic needs such as increased access to clean water. Additionally, mountainous regions make conditions inhospitable for mosquitos carrying the disease."
