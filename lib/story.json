        "description": "2007 is the first year of the dataset. Coastal regions show very minor incidence rates while eastern jungle and savanna regions show incidence rates between 500 to 1000 cases. Florencia, the municipality with the highest incidence rates, has more than double the cases than the trailing municipality Fortul. Throughout the years, many municipalities and the surrounding regions that have high incidence rates will continue to show similar trends in cases."

        "year": 2008,
        "description": "2008 shows relatively low incidence rates throughout the country, with most cases being isolated in the eastern savanna regions of the east. This is the second year that Florencia top the municipalities with the greatest incidence rates, with over 3300 cases. Only 4 municipalities topped 1500 cases."

        "year": 2009,
        "description": "2009 sees the start of an upcoming epidemic in the eastern regions. Florencia is the first municipality that breaks the 4000 case line, while Fortul follows closely behind. The top 10 municipalities all have incidence rates higher than 1000, while only three are higher than 2000."

        "year": 2010,
        "description": "2010 is the first year where we can determine an epidemic has occurred. This is noted by the sharp increase in dengue cases across the entire country. The top 10 municipalities have incidence rates greater than 1900. Fortul sees the highest number of cases throughout the entire study, with a rate of nearly 14,000 cases reported. This is also the first year Nilo is seen in the top 10 municipalities, as we will see later as years pass."

        "year": 2011,
        "description": "2011 sees significantly less cases than last year, marking this as an endemic year. Only 6 municipalities crossed the 1000 cases mark. Florencia sees the greatest number of cases at roughly 4800 cases. This is also the last year Florencia is in the top 10 municipalities with the highest incidence rates."

        "year": 2012,
        "description": "2012 sees similar incidence rates than the previous year, although no municipality sees rates higher than 1800. This is the second endemic year after the high rates of 2010. The top 10 municipalities are all greater than 1000 cases. This is also the second year we see Nilo top the incidence rates."

        "year": 2013,
        "description": "2013 sees higher incidence rates than the previous year. Although only one municipality, Nilo, spiked higher than 5000 incidents, many municipalities in the north, east, and south show rates between 1000 to 1500 incidents. This is the second year Nilo has been an active hotspot for dengue."

This is the third consecutive year of Nilo as a hotspot for cases, and the second as the municipality with the highest rate, although the number is lower than the previous year."

    {
        "year": 2015,
        "description": "2015 sees similar incidence rates than the previous year, with slightly higher numbers. This is the first year when Nilo drops less than 1500 cases, as well as from the top 10 municipalities with the highest incidence rates."

        "year": 2016,
        "description": "2016 also sees a small increase in the incidence rates, but these rates are concentrated on a select few municipalities. The top 10 municipalities had incidence rates higher than 2000 cases. Nilo returns to the top 10 municipalities as a hotspot."

    {
        "year": 2018,
        "description": "2018 can also be classified as an endemic year, as only one municipality crossed 1500 incidents. Compared to last year, more municipalities have incidence rates between 300 to 500 cases."

    {
        "year": 2019,
        "description": "2019, the last year of data available, can also be classified as an epidemic year. Northern municipalities see a sharp uptick in cases along with the usual high incidence rates of the eastern savanna region. Of the 10 municipalities with the highest case, Leticia is the only hotspot in the amazon region, likely sharing high cases with Brazil and Peru."
